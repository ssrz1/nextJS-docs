/*
  Detailed Overview of Routing and Navigation in Next.js:

  1. Code Splitting:
     - Automatically divides application code into smaller chunks.
     - Each route segment has its own bundle, reducing initial load time.
     - Server Components are utilized to load only the necessary code for the current route, enhancing performance.

  2. Prefetching:
     - Routes are preloaded in the background to speed up navigation.
     - <Link> component: Automatically prefetches routes when they appear in the viewport or on page load.
     - useRouter().prefetch(): Allows for manual prefetching of routes.
     - Prefetch behavior can be customized with the prefetch prop on the <Link> component:
       - `true`: Prefetches the full page data.
       - `false`: Disables prefetching.
       - `null` or unspecified: Prefetches up to the first loading.js boundary, cached for 30 seconds.

  3. Caching:
     - Utilizes an in-memory cache (Router Cache) to store prefetched and visited route segments.
     - Reduces server requests and data transfer by reusing cached data during navigation.
     - Enhances user experience by providing faster route transitions.

  4. Partial Rendering:
     - Only the route segments that change are re-rendered during navigation.
     - Shared segments (like layouts) are preserved, minimizing the data transfer and rendering time.
     - Example: Navigating between /dashboard/settings and /dashboard/analytics re-renders only the specific content pages, keeping the dashboard layout intact.

  5. Soft Navigation:
     - Implements "soft navigation" which avoids full page reloads.
     - Only changed route segments are updated, allowing React state to be preserved.
     - Provides a smoother and faster navigation experience.

  6. Back and Forward Navigation:
     - Maintains scroll position during back and forward navigation.
     - Reuses cached route segments for efficient navigation.

  7. Routing between pages/ and app/:
     - Handles transitions between traditional pages and new app routes seamlessly.
     - Uses a probabilistic client router filter to manage transitions, minimizing false positives.
     - Configuration options:
       - `experimental.clientRouterFilterAllowedRate`: Adjusts the likelihood of false positives.
       - `experimental.clientRouterFilter`: Can be set to false to disable automatic handling and manage routing manually.

  These features collectively improve the performance, efficiency, and user experience of applications built with Next.js by optimizing data usage and reducing load times.

// 8. Route Handlers:
//
// **What Are Route Handlers?**
// Route Handlers in Next.js are special functions that let you define how your application responds to specific HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Think of them as mini-APIs that live alongside your frontend code.
//
// **Why Use Route Handlers?**
// - **Organized Structure**: By placing API logic near your frontend components, your project stays well-organized and easier to navigate.
// - **Better Performance**: Route Handlers can take advantage of serverless functions, which means faster response times and efficient scaling.
// - **Improved Security**: Since the logic runs on the server, sensitive data and operations remain hidden from the client, enhancing your appâ€™s security.
//
// **Simple Example:**
// Imagine you want to create an API endpoint to get a list of users and another to add a new user.
//
// ```javascript
// // app/api/users/route.js

// // Handle GET requests - fetch all users
// export async function GET(request) {
//   const users = await fetchUsersFromDatabase();
//   return new Response(JSON.stringify(users), {
//     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
//   });
// }

// // Handle POST requests - add a new user
// export async function POST(request) {
//   const newUser = await request.json();
//   await addUserToDatabase(newUser);
//   return new Response(JSON.stringify(newUser), { status: 201 });
// }
// ```
//
// **How to Use Route Handlers:**
// 1. **Create the File Structure**: Place your Route Handlers inside the `app/api` directory, following the desired URL path. For example, `app/api/users/route.js` corresponds to the `/api/users` endpoint.
// 2. **Define HTTP Methods**: Export functions named after HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) to handle different types of requests.
// 3. **Implement Logic**: Inside each function, write the logic to handle the request, such as fetching data from a database or processing input.
//
// **Tips for Using Route Handlers:**
// - **Error Handling**: Always handle potential errors to ensure your API responds gracefully. Use try-catch blocks to manage exceptions.
// - **Authentication**: Protect sensitive endpoints by verifying user authentication and authorization before processing requests.
// - **Validation**: Validate incoming data to prevent invalid or malicious data from affecting your application.
//
// **Advanced Features:**
// - **Middleware Integration**: Combine Route Handlers with middleware to add functionalities like logging, authentication checks, or request modifications.
// - **Streaming Responses**: For large amounts of data, use streaming to send information in chunks, improving performance and user experience.
// - **Edge Functions**: Deploy Route Handlers as edge functions to run them closer to your users geographically, reducing latency and enhancing speed.
//
// **Benefits Recap:**
// - **Seamless Integration**: Keep your API logic close to your frontend, making your codebase easier to manage.
// - **Performance**: Utilize serverless and edge computing for faster and scalable responses.
// - **Security**: Keep sensitive operations and data safely on the server side.
//
// By leveraging Route Handlers, you can build robust, efficient, and secure APIs that seamlessly integrate with your Next.js frontend, enhancing both development experience and application performance.
