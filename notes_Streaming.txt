    // ## What is Streaming?
    // 
    // Streaming in Next.js allows the server to send HTML to the client in smaller chunks as they are rendered, rather than waiting for the entire page to be ready. This approach improves perceived loading performance and enables users to interact with parts of the page sooner.
    // 
    // ## How Streaming Works
    // 
    // 1. **Chunking HTML**: The server breaks down the HTML into smaller, manageable chunks corresponding to different components or sections of the page.
    // 2. **Progressive Sending**: These chunks are sent to the client incrementally as they are ready, allowing parts of the page to be displayed immediately.
    // 3. **Client Rendering and Hydration**: The client receives and renders these chunks incrementally and hydrates them to make them interactive.
    // 
    // ## Benefits of Streaming
    // 
    // - **Reduced Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: Sending HTML in smaller chunks decreases the initial response time.
    // - **Improved First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Users see meaningful content more quickly.
    // - **Enhanced Time to Interactive (TTI)**: Interactivity becomes available sooner as critical components hydrate before others.
    // - **Better Performance on Slower Devices**: Incremental rendering reduces the load on devices with limited resources.
    // 
    // ## Example of Streaming in Practice
    // 
    // Consider a product page:
    // 
    // - **High-Priority Components**: Product images and descriptions are streamed first, allowing users to view essential details immediately.
    // - **Low-Priority Components**: Customer reviews and related products are streamed afterward, enabling the page to become interactive while additional content loads in the background.
    // 
    // ## Implementation in Next.js
    // 
    // Streaming is integrated into the Next.js App Router by default. Developers can further control streaming behavior using `loading.js` and React Suspense to manage loading states and UI components.
    // 
    // ## Conclusion
    // 
    // Streaming enhances the performance and user experience of Next.js applications by enabling incremental rendering and hydration. This leads to faster load times and improved interactivity, especially beneficial for complex or data-heavy pages.
